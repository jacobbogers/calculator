# Google-like Calculator Project

## The scope of the project is limited to:

### Use of the mathematical operators:

-  `+`: addition.
-  `-`: subtraction
-  `ร`: multiplication
-  `รท`: division

### Use of the edit control buttons:

-  `CE`: clear entry (backspace)
-  `CA`: clear All (only clears result entry after `=` is pressed)

### Output formatting:

Some floating point numbers are formatted in shorter form (following the rules of google calculator) to make it readable to a human.

Example: `0.2 + 0.4` is `0.6` instead of `0.6000000000000001`

The number itself is not adjusted to be `0.6` it is only visually adjusted for display.

### Google expression history

Google expression history is implemented, although only (for now) the previous expression/result is visually shown.

### Google bugs avoided

It seems incomplete fractions can be entered in google calculator

Example`.-.` (this will lead to an error mention).

It is not possible to enter such calculations in the first place.

**What is NOT implemented**

- Keystrokes (only mouse usage buttons).
- Other mathematical functions (`log`, `sin` etc).
- Explicit scoping `(` and `)`.
- Google past history selection

## Modules

This is a git mono-repo:

The project consist of 2 sub-projects a Web frontend and a REST api backend.

### Rest API

This project lives in subdirectory `./api`. For a more specific technical information see [this][rest-api-readme] document.

### Web Frontend

This project lives in subdirectory `./web`. For a more specific technical information see [this][web-readme] document.

## Installation and usage

The project lives in 2 docker containers started by the command

```bash
docker compose up
```

Navigate your browser to `localhost:8080` to use the application.
